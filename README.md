This is a small project from CodeAcademy working with the Spotify API. I added in some advanced features including:

- Ability to see current user's playlist (defaulted to 20)
- Ability to click into a user's playlist to see what songs are included
- Ability to click on a song in a user's playlist and be sent to a Spotify page to play that song
